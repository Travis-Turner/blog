            <h2>Game of Fifteen</h2>
            <h3>CS50 - 1-1-17</h3>
            <p>
               After finishing the find problem in PSET3, I moved on to the Game of Fifteen problem.  This took a considerable amount of
               time.  I spent hours tracking down a bug.  I had accidentily modified the main function beyond the original parameters of what was asked.
               It was very frustrating.  I thought I was going crazy at one point, I had become Ahab, crazed in pursuit of my white whale.  because I knew the logic made sense, but it just wasn't working.
               I did eventually find it.  Upon completion, to paraphrase a very famous quote - in that moment, I was eurphoric.
               <br><br>
               I did some work on my app as well, adding in more testing.  I'm going to be adding a new feature shortly.  I've also begun
               work on a React project - a tic-tac-toe game.  Let's see what I can cook up.

               Back to the Game of Fifteen problem.  As it happens, CS50 has rolled over in the new year, and that particular problem will no longer be worth any credit.
               I now have to do a Music problem, which I am hard at work at.  I am actually pretty proud of the solution I'm working on, so we will see.

               I believe that the temperature reached below 0 here last night.  I have put pillows around my doors to try and keep the heat in. 
               I am cold in my dreams now.

         <h2>CS50</h2>
         <h3>Algorithms - 12-31-17</h3>
         <p>
          I resumed work on CS50.  I'm on week 3, currently doing PSET3. This one involves constructing some
          basic algorithms.  For my sorting algorithm, I've currently went with insertion sort, though I may change 
          that. For my finding algorithm, I implemented a binary search.  I was able to successfully pass all of the
          tests.    With binary search, I really took time to understand every single part of the algorithm.  Then I did the same
            with the insertion sort.  The success cases, the failure cases, the way everything increments.   I also did a little work on my app, implementing some more tests. I'm starting to get 
          really comfortable with testing.  As I write this, there is less than an hour until 2018.  May it be the

      <h3>Spent the night testing - 12-30-17</h3>
      <p>
        Finished book one of 'You Don't Know JavaScript'.  The book promises on the fly compiling will be discussed in a later 
        chapter, so I will hold that thought.  I started my app over, this time with a more thorough implementation plan.
        I've already made much progress.  I've implemented testing on a feature - asynchronous data 
        retrieval from a database.  I am
        begining to like testing.  It is below freezing. I spent those hours beside my tiny
        heater, under my blanket. And I ate a lot of peanut butter.  It is a good food.

      <h3>YDKJ - 12-29-17</h3>
      <p>
        I continued work on my app.  Ran into an issue trying to re-render based on data in the redux
        store instead of component state.  Sorted that out.  Began re-reading 'You Don't Know JavaScript' by Kyle Simpson.  My second 
        read through.  chapter 1 was all review.  One sentence caught my attention this time.  The 
        book states that JavaScript is not interpreted, but is instead compiled on the fly and immediatley returned. This seems like 
        an inefficient way of operating.  Further reading necessary.</p>

        Regarding yesterday's post, my new setup has proven productive, though not perfect. My chair is 
        comfortable for a $5 dollar chair. But in the grand scheme of chairs, a back-breaker.

         Today I set up my computer.  A long story.  I installed Ubuntuu and set up two screens.  
         Nearby, I have my laptop.  Until this point, I'd been doing my 
         development work on the laptop.  Having this much screen - a joy.
         Possibility.

      <p>
        Finished book one of 'You Don't Know JavaScript'.  The book promises on the fly compiling will be discussed in a later 
        chapter, so I will hold that thought.  I started my app over, this time with a more thorough implementation plan.
        I've already made much progress.  I've implemented testing on a feature - asynchronous data 
        retrieval from a database.  I am
        begining to like testing.  It is below freezing. I spent those hours beside my tiny
        heater, under my blanket. And I ate a lot of peanut butter.  It is a good food.

      <h1>Day II</h2>
      <h2>YDKJ - 12-29-17</h2>

        I continued work on my app.  Ran into an issue trying to re-render based on data in the redux
        store instead of component state.  Sorted that out.  Began re-reading 'You Don't Know JavaScript' by Kyle Simpson.  My second 
        read through.  chapter 1 was all review.  One sentence caught my attention this time.  The 
        book states that JavaScript is not interpreted, but is instead compiled on the fly and immediatley returned. This seems like 
        an inefficient way of operating.  Further reading necessary.</p>

        Regarding yesterday's post, my new setup has proven productive, though not perfect. My chair is 
        comfortable for a $5 dollar chair. But in the grand scheme of chairs, a back-breaker.

      <h2>Initial comment - 12-28-17</h2>
      <p>Today I set up my computer.  A long story.  I installed Ubuntuu and set up two screens.  
      Nearby, I have my laptop.  Until this point, I'd been doing my 
      development work on the laptop.  Having this much screen - a joy.
      Possibility.</p>

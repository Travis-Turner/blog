         <h2>CS50</h2>
         <h3>Algorithms - 12-31-17</h3>
         <p>
          I resumed work on CS50.  I'm on week 3, currently doing PSET3. This one involves constructing some
          basic algorithms.  For my sorting algorithm, I've currently went with insertion sort, though I may change 
          that. For my finding algorithm, I implemented a binary search.  I was able to successfully pass all of the
          tests.    With binary search, I really took time to understand every single part of the algorithm.  Then I did the same
            with the insertion sort.  The success cases, the failure cases, the way everything increments.   I also did a little work on my app, implementing some more tests. I'm starting to get 
          really comfortable with testing.  As I write this, there is less than an hour until 2018.  May it be the

      <h3>Spent the night testing - 12-30-17</h3>
      <p>
        Finished book one of 'You Don't Know JavaScript'.  The book promises on the fly compiling will be discussed in a later 
        chapter, so I will hold that thought.  I started my app over, this time with a more thorough implementation plan.
        I've already made much progress.  I've implemented testing on a feature - asynchronous data 
        retrieval from a database.  I am
        begining to like testing.  It is below freezing. I spent those hours beside my tiny
        heater, under my blanket. And I ate a lot of peanut butter.  It is a good food.

      <h2>Day II</h2>
      <h3>YDKJ - 12-29-17</h3>
      <p>
        I continued work on my app.  Ran into an issue trying to re-render based on data in the redux
        store instead of component state.  Sorted that out.  Began re-reading 'You Don't Know JavaScript' by Kyle Simpson.  My second 
        read through.  chapter 1 was all review.  One sentence caught my attention this time.  The 
        book states that JavaScript is not interpreted, but is instead compiled on the fly and immediatley returned. This seems like 
        an inefficient way of operating.  Further reading necessary.</p>

        Regarding yesterday's post, my new setup has proven productive, though not perfect. My chair is 
        comfortable for a $5 dollar chair. But in the grand scheme of chairs, a back-breaker.

      <h2>Hello World</h2>

         Today I set up my computer.  A long story.  I installed Ubuntuu and set up two screens.  
         Nearby, I have my laptop.  Until this point, I'd been doing my 
         development work on the laptop.  Having this much screen - a joy.
         Possibility.

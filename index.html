               <h2>Redux</h2>

               <p>
                  I have an electric blanket now.  Work has continued on my app.  I've started to get more comfortable with how Redux works.  This, along with my experience using React,
                  has made me more comfortable with the idea of managing state.  My initial forrays into state management were back when I was using jQuery - in hindsight, it all seems so <em>primitive</em>.
                  I found an old email from where I started back on CodeAcademy.  It was back in Sept. 2016.  So, 15 months ago.  I remember I took a pretty
                  long break after that still and really didn't immerse myself in programming until March of 2017.  When I started CodeAcademy, I knew so little.  It is
                  amazing what can change with dedication.  Even though the path going forward remains endless, it is rather nice to be able to look back and see
                  the progress made.  I would recommend CodeAcademy along with MIT's Scratch program to any person who is very technically green but wanted to 
                  peek behind the curtain.

                 Today a fuse blew.  So half of my sockets aren't working.  Things have gotten pretty cold now.  The outlet
                 was brown.  I guess it's a good thing.  Replacing the fuse didn't seem to fix anything.  Moving on.  I can better 
                 appreciate the language of math now.  The deception with math is that something so complex can be represented by
                 something so small.  That turned me off of formal math for a long time.  A couple of months ago, I spent virtually
                 all of my free time on Khan Academy catching up.  What a great resource that would've been in my school days.
                 I wonder if today's youth know how lucky they are to have it.  My gut tells me... maybe.

                 Yesterday I completed the music problem in CS50.  Now I'm moving on to the next lecture.  This is my first 
                 real explanation of pointers, although I was already aware of some of their workings due to how objects work
                 in JavaScript, although there's probably quite a difference lower languages, C included.  Still, it's been
                 helpful.  I spent a lot of time cleaning today.  I swept the dust out of my room.

               <p>
                  I'm continuing on with the CS50, I'm now into the music problem as I mentioned in my last post.  It took a bit of work, but I was able to get my solution working properly.  That's only 1/3rd of the work to be done, but I think it was the hardest part.  
                  It was the last thing you were supposed to do anyway, but I did it first.  It's been over two years since I started coding.  The first thing I started on, I went and bought a book called 'Code' by Charles Petzold.  I do recommend this book.  It gets a little bit
                  too technical for a pure introduction to programming, but that's towards the end of the book.  For the first half or so, it's an amazing 
                  book that talks about coincidence, discovery, and the history of code.  Code surrounds us, binds us together.  It's literally
                  in our DNA.  Again, I do recommend that book.

            <h2>Game of Fifteen</h2>
            <h3>CS50 - 1-1-17</h3>
            <p>
               After finishing the find problem in PSET3, I moved on to the Game of Fifteen problem.  This took a considerable amount of
               time.  I spent hours tracking down a bug.  I had accidentily modified the main function beyond the original parameters of what was asked.
               It was very frustrating.  I thought I was going crazy at one point, I had become Ahab, crazed in pursuit of my white whale.  because I knew the logic made sense, but it just wasn't working.
               I did eventually find it.  Upon completion, to paraphrase a very, very famous quote - in that moment, I was eurphoric.
               <br><br>
               I did some work on my app as well, adding in more testing.  I'm going to be adding a new feature shortly.  I've also begun
               work on a React project - a tic-tac-toe game.  Let's see what I can cook up.
               <br><br>
               Back to the Game of Fifteen problem.  As it happens, CS50 has rolled over in the new year, and that particular problem will no longer be worth any credit.
               I now have to do a Music problem, which I am hard at work at.  I am actually pretty proud of the solution I'm working on, so we will see.

               I believe that the temperature reached below 0 here last night.  I have put pillows around my doors to try and keep the heat in. 
               I am cold in my dreams now.

         <h3>Algorithms - 12-31-17</h3>
         <p>
          I resumed work on CS50.  I'm on week 3, currently doing PSET3. This one involves constructing some
          basic algorithms.  For my sorting algorithm, I've currently went with insertion sort, though I may change 
          that. For my finding algorithm, I implemented a binary search.  I was able to successfully pass all of the
          tests.    With binary search, I really took time to understand every single part of the algorithm.  Then I did the same
            with the insertion sort.  The success cases, the failure cases, the way everything increments.   I also did a little work on my app, implementing some more tests. I'm starting to get 
          really comfortable with testing.  As I write this, there is less than an hour until 2018.  May it be the

      <h3>Spent the night testing - 12-30-17</h3>
      <p>
        Finished book one of 'You Don't Know JavaScript'.  The book promises on the fly compiling will be discussed in a later 
        chapter, so I will hold that thought.  I started my app over, this time with a more thorough implementation plan.
        I've already made much progress.  I've implemented testing on a feature - asynchronous data 
        retrieval from a database.  I am
        begining to like testing.  It is below freezing. I spent those hours beside my tiny
        heater, under my blanket. And I ate a lot of peanut butter.  It is a good food.

      <h2>Day II</h2>
      <h3>YDKJ - 12-29-17</h3>
      <p>
        I continued work on my app.  Ran into an issue trying to re-render based on data in the redux
        store instead of component state.  Sorted that out.  Began re-reading 'You Don't Know JavaScript' by Kyle Simpson.  My second 
        read through.  chapter 1 was all review.  One sentence caught my attention this time.  The 
        book states that JavaScript is not interpreted, but is instead compiled on the fly and immediatley returned. This seems like 
        an inefficient way of operating.  Further reading necessary.</p>

        Regarding yesterday's post, my new setup has proven productive, though not perfect. My chair is 
        comfortable for a $5 dollar chair. But in the grand scheme of chairs, a back-breaker.

         Today I set up my computer.  A long story.  I installed Ubuntuu and set up two screens.  
         Nearby, I have my laptop.  Until this point, I'd been doing my 
         development work on the laptop.  Having this much screen - a joy.
         Possibility.
